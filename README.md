Arist is my project of creating the best open source java decompiler

### Motiavation

It's highly inspired by procyon - it's light, fast and not bloated, can be conveniently used from command line, and even have optional syntax highlighting. But it have significant disadvantage - it fails to generate code sometimes and targetet only for java 8. So Arist aims to eliminate that by being easy-extensible so in case if problem of such kind appears it can be solved in no time.
To build it just execute `./gradlew shadowJar`

It actually in super mega experimental state and tons of things like branching or lambdas stays for now unimplemented so don't expect too much of it
